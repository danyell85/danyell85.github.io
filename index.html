		<p>Welcome to my current work in progress. Over the next couple months be amazed by the progress the site will make. It started with basic HTML and CSS. I implemented bootstrap and will be playing around with it more.</p><p> On to me, I currently reside in San Fransico,Ca. It has been my home for the past 4 years. When I relocated I started taking CS classes at the community college and became hooked on programming. I decided to make a career change and applied to DevBootCamp. The next 9 weeks will be a journey of knowledge and endurance.</p><p>Although I dont see much free time in my future but when I do have it back I love watching Star Trek, hiking and reading reddit.</p> <p>Welcome to my current work in progress.
