<!--
	My pair was great but I dont feel that pairing was needed for this challenge. Most
	of the work was already completed through other releases and it was just adding HTML
	tags for the body of the blog content which took very little time. Wireframing is very helpful
	it makes sure you dont get off track with what you are trying to accomplish. My pair and I didnt 
	discuss what would make a good wireframe. We did discuss keeping it simple and then building on it 
	as we became more comfortable using HTML5. We learned the that time tag in HTML5 really doesnt do anything.
