 <p> Prior to applying to DBC my main concern was the enviroment.  I read blog after blog and people wrote how amazing or some verision of it being awesome. It was like the Everything Is Awesome Lego Movie Song on repeat.I was skeptical and was thinking 30 people in a room spending 10 hours a day must drive each other crazy. So, I made an appt. for a tour. My skepticism very quickly died down. Everyone was happy, working together, exicted, the staff was informative. Going, seeing and feeling what it would be like to go to DBC made my desicion to apply a peice of cake. It was what I was looking for my programming experience to be.
    <p> The DBC experience isnt just going to be shoving code down your throat for 18 weeks but helping your grow as a person and a programmer. I will find the emotional aspects at times just as challenging as coding but will be able to grow from them. Yes, I am nervous. Yes, I am excited. No, I dont think it will easy. But I am looking forward to going through all these stages together. The only way to engage in this type of enviroment for me is to be open; open to being nervous, open to learning, open to advice and open to having fun.
