		<div class="blogtitle">Ruby Hashes vs. JS Objects</div>
			<br>
		<section>
			Ruby hashes are a collection of objects and their values. It is like a dictionary. When looking up a work(a key in a hash) there is a definition next to the word (a value in a hash). The hash is a collection of all those words aka keys and there definitions aka values. Example below:
			<code><xmp> hash = {key1 => value1,
								key2 => value2,
								key3 => value3,
								keyx => valuex}
						hash ={
							   key1 :value1,
							   key2 :value2,
							   key3 :value3,
							   keyx :valuex}		
			</xmp></code></section>

		<section>
			In Javascript , an objects are a collection of properties with an value attached to the it. Example would be an object bike. This bike would have properties of color, wheels, weight. Example below<code><xmp>
					var bike = {
						color: blue,
						wheels: 17,
						weight: 15,
					};		
			</xmp></code></section>
		<section>
			The examples and overall definitions are both make them pretty comparable but there are some differences. The writing of them is the first noticable one. In JavaScript you have to define an object with the keyword var for JavaScript to interpeter it correctly. Ruby has two different formats where are JavaScript has one. </section><br>
		<section>
			The way they are accessed is different as well. Ruby uses bracket notation.
			<code><xmp>
				hash_name[:key] -> value
			</xmp></code></section>
		<section>
			JavaScript uses dot notation:
			<code><xmp>
				object_name.property -> value
			</xmp></code>
