			<h4>Pairing</h4>
			Pairing with others to solve challenges is nerve racking to me. It amplifies my insecurities about being slow
			 or not understanding. When I am alone I can pace myself or come back to a challenge after reflecting. It is enjoyable
			 to share ideas with another student. This was a reason I decided to apply to DBC. Doing challenges over google hangouts
			 can become frustrating. You cant read the social cues that are present when in person. It is easy to start talking over
			 your pair since you cant always see if they are about to speak.<br>
			 <h4>Feedback</h4>
			 Getting feedback has been enlightening. I have learned the importance of getting to know my partner before jumping
			 into a challenge. It has been something mentioned in my feedback that would have been better for me to do. I thought
			 I was doing this but from reading my feedback I do not understand their learning style. For my next pairing I need to 
			 ask that specific question so I can be aware while coding. <br>
			 I enjoy writing the feedback. Having to be specific has helped me narrow down what I enjoyed most from the sessions and learned. 
			 When offering actionable feedback it can be tricky. Sometimes the first thing that comes to mind is a preference of mine that they are unaware of. Offering feedback on that isnt helpful since it can only apply to me and how I felt. I usually give actionable feedback on coding issues that they became stuck on and could benefit from practicing more.
