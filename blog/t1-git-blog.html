        First week in and I have can say that I wish I bought a mac prior to DBC! Note to anyone starting I cannot stress that when first learning, trying to do it on windows in a virtual enviroment made for a very frustating journey. You might have better luck than me but know you might need outside help and dont be shy asking for. On a better note, once setup was under control I was able to start my dev journey bringing me to this blog to share what I have learned.

        Version control is going to be your best friend. It allows you to make edits to files, save them but not altering the original until you tell it too. And if you happen to make a mistake uploading that file you can restore a previous verison. VC allows working with others on the same project at the time.  
    </p>

      Git helps you keep track of changes by commit messages. It allows a user to view what was done to each verision. You can track down when and what was changed.

      Using github allows a person to store their code, projects, whatever they want to a central place. Regardless of what laptop or computer you are on you can access your files. Github uses git a version controller. Tricky it can be with similar names and them working together. Github holds your content while git keeps track of version/edits that you send to github to store. And remember since git is a VC it allows for collaboration. Withing Github you can allow people to review, comment or edit your projects
