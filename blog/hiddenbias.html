			After reading about Hidden Bias, it encouraged me to take the Gender-Science Test from <a href ="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/"> Project Implicit Website </a>. After the test my results came back that I had a slight association with men in the science and women in liberal arts. Not surprising results since men hold most jobs within the science/tech industry albeit a little disappointing. <br>
			To combat these feelings I wasn’t aware I even had the first step was taking the test and evaluating the results.  True, I only took one test and that isn’t enough evidence that those could be my hidden biases. But knowing hidden biases are valid, I should work on recognizing any that I have taking it from there. <br>
			I have found when mediating and doing it regularly it helps me recognize in that moment my feelings and thoughts more clearly. In being mindful, I can change my thought process or at least identify what triggered me to have a hidden bias and work on it from there.  With any bias, recognizing you have it is the hardest part and with work overtime you can overcome it.
