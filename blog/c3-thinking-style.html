			<br>
			I have a multimodal learning style that mostly leans towards visual and read/write. In the program so far the read/write ascept of my learning style has been helpful. Having to read a document and then type out code has help me retain the information. This has only helped me when working alone. During the guided pair sessions the navigator will read instructions outloud. During this I tend to not absorb the instructions and have to go back to the document myself. This at times defeats their purpose as a navigator and slows down the coding session. 
			To address this weakness of mine I first need to place myself in an distraction free enviroment. This mostly will be my house and not trying to do GPS while at the library with people around. At DBC there will be distractions but in practicing learning verbally at home, I will have improved upon this weakness to better prepare myself for onsite. At home, I can start listening to the books I read on audible instead of reading them. The more I replace things I read to verbal ones I will start improving.
			To keep making progress in my learning style I need to keep practicing my thinking style. Verbally reconigizing when I make small accomplishments to keep encouraging myself to move forward. I have made list of the weeks task and at the end of each I verbally have to compliment myself on completing and what I felt I did well during it. Slowly I will start to feel good about the things I struggle with and look forward to doing them.
