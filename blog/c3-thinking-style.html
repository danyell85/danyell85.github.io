			<br>
			<h3>Always Learning</h3>
			 <br>
			According to my test, I am an abstract random thinker. An AR thinking style allows me to visualize to understand what I cannot see while organizing information into chunks without a specific order. After reading this, I started thinking I must have a chaotic mind that wanders off. But reflecting on the past three weeks I can see the benefit of being able to visualize potenial ideas for coding projects. In my mind when I start thinking of how to solve a challenge I have blackboard in my mind that moves ideas back and forth. As for the random part of my thinking style, I have had to curb it this week. I found using the pseudo-code helped me not make mistakes by jumping forward. Once I have an idea I go for it and will skip steps or start coding one part without realizing the affects on others parts until later. <br>
			I have worked on having a growth mindset for the past couple of years. It is always a work in progress but having the basics down has helped in my confidence level at DBC. It reminds me that what I find to be scary in this process can be overcome by verbally celebrating my success and turning my fear into an opporunity. I become so nervous before the peer coding session. I have doubts that I am going to offer anything to the session, I will be too slow, etc.. To combat these feelings I do review the material beforehand, go over possible solutions,do deep breathing to calm down and recognize afterwards that I made it out alive and remember the enjoyable parts of the session. In time I will start mainly remembering the positives and look forward to working with others.
