		<p><h3>We Are Not Smart</h3>
		I picked up dancing, gymnastics and cheerleading in the third grade. Competed nationally and excelled at cheerleading thought out high school. Until I transferred high school I wasn’t aware that the stereotype of cheerleaders being stupid was a thing that "real" people believed. I saw it in movies but within the schools and friends prior, it was an accomplishment, something I was proud of. <b>
		Then that day came, I walked into AP Physics wearing my uniform for the first day of school and my teacher asked if I had walked into the wrong classroom. It was embarrassing. I went from feeling great to feeling I wasn’t worthy to be in his class because of my clothing and passion. He used "me" in examples of how the ditzy cheerleader would be sunbathing instead of studying so calculate her surface area while she is at the beach. The problem was more challenging than that but the person in the example and what she was doing is accurate. <b>
		I had taken AP and Honors classes all four years of high school, I received a scholarship, why did I feel so stupid in his class? I struggled in his class. I got a C bot semesters. Being stereotyped as stupid in his class affected me greatly. I felt I had a role to play to socially be accepted in his class. I never wanted to attend and had more absence in that class than any other. Of course not attending class played into my grade and it was my choice not to go. At that age I wasn’t able to recognize the effects of stereotyping had on me. <b>
		Reflecting on the experience, I didn’t want to attend because I didn’t want to be the joke, I didn’t want to feel stupid because of practicing cheerleading. After listening to Claude Steele and the effects of stereotyping I learned that stereotyping causes heightened stress and absorbing less information due to the negative stereotype. As a coping mechanism I adapted to the role I had to play and it affect my learning in his class.
