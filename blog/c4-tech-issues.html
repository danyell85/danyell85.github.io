			<br>
			
		<p>Women have started to enter the tech field, a mostly man dominated industry and for some this has created a problem. People mostly dont like change, it is something you have to put effort into to adapt and I believe this causes a biased on women entering this field. This bias could really be in regards to anything, as long as it distrupts the status quo. The old culture that was created has to conform to the changes a women might bring to it. Not everyone wants to make those changes to create a more dynamic workplace.<br>
		It is easy to look at these changes as bad when there is a small percantage making that change. To keep the current status in the comfort zone, others can make women feel not welcome or not good enough to be in this industry that they choose to be a part of. <br>
		I took a visual basics course at the community college to see if programming was my passion. I was hooked instantly but I didnt feel my teacher was thrilled. I was one of two girls in a class of twenty men. The students didnt see the gender difference when it came to coding. But my teacher was more critcal of my code and at one point accused me of cheating because a male students code was very similar to mine. I shared this with the male student and he didnt recieve the same accusation. I didnt understand why it was assumed I would be the one who cheated and not the other student. My conclusion was that my teacher was from an older culture, one that didnt have women in the industry. He has taught and watched mainly male students succeed so when it came to someone cheating, I was the assumption.<br>
		It would be nice to flip a switch and people accepted change overnight but people need time to adapt. As younger people enter the workforce with new ideas the culture will steadily progress. By all means, I am not saying every male or the industry is out to get females. It is that people dont like changes to their comfortable enviroments and tech happens to be a male dominated field.
