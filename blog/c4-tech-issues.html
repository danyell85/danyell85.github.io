		<h3>Old School Thinking</h3>
		
		Women have started to enter the tech field, a mostly man dominated industry and for some this has created a problem. People mostly don’t like change, it is something you have to put effort into to adapt and I believe this causes a biased on women entering this field. This bias could really be in regards to anything, as long as it disrupts the status quo. The old culture that was created has to conform to the changes a woman might bring to it. Not everyone wants to make those changes to create a more dynamic workplace.<br>
		It is easy to look at these changes as bad when there is a small percentage making that change. According to Forbes only 1/3 of the workplace in Silicon Valley are women. To keep the current status in the comfort zone, others can make women feel not welcome or not good enough to be in this industry that they choose to be a part of.<br> 
		I took a visual basics course at the community college to see if programming was my passion. I was hooked instantly but I didn’t feel my teacher was thrilled. I was one of two girls in a class of twenty men. The student’s didn’t see the gender difference when it came to coding. But my teacher was more critical of my code and at one point accused me of cheating because a male student’s code was very similar to mine. I shared this with the male student and he didn’t receive the same accusation. I didn’t understand why it was assumed I would be the one who cheated and not the other student. My conclusion was that my teacher was from an older culture, one that didn’t have women in the industry. He has taught and watched mainly male students succeed so when it came to someone cheating, I was the assumption. This is purely my two cents on the matter that occurred and there are many possible explanations for this. <br>
		Besides my feelings regarding my teacher the ratio of women was super low. Two out of 20 of us! There have been many programs launched starting at the elementary level to encourage and provide outreach to creating a more diverse culture in the tech field. I couldn’t find exactly when most of these programs took place but it will take time for women that are being reached at the elementary level to start changing the percentage in the workplace.<br>
		It would be nice to flip a switch and people accepted change overnight but people need time to adapt. As younger people enter the workforce with new ideas the culture will steadily progress. By all means, I am not saying every male or the industry is out to get females. It is that people don’t like changes to their comfortable environments and tech happens to be a male dominated field.
