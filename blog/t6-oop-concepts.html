		<p><h2>Scope of Variables</h2>
			This week I struggled with variable scopes. So, what better way to try to reinforce my learning that blogging about them.<br>
			Scopes are defined as wehre the variables are visible in the program. When determining the scope of a variable you want to think about where the variables should only be able to be accessed. Which methods or classes need to access that variable? This prevents other components of the program from changing the variable.
			<h2>Variable Types &amp; How To Name Them</h2>
			Global: Global variables have the scope to be accessed anywhere within the ruby program. Global variables are named by calling a $variablename.<br>
			Class: Class variables are shared with all instances of a specific class. They are named by @@variablename</br>
			Instance: Instance variables are specific to the instance of a class. They are named by @variablename</br>
			Local: Local variables havea scope that is limiting. They are only valid within the block or method they are created in. Local variables are named by lowercase letters or with underscores.<br>
			Constants: Constant variables have a value that cannot be changed by the program. It stays constant. Constant variables are named with all UPPERCASE lettter.<br>
